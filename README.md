# Desafio da Matemática
### Version 0.1.0 - alpha

## Main objective
This game is a project created in a Brazilian school in Japan. Its goal is to help young students improve their fast-thinking and math skills while still having fun and tracking their progress.

### Tech Stack
- Unity
- C#
- Built-in Render Pipeline
- SQLite (planned)

## Gameplay
After choosing one of the three difficulties — easy, medium, or hard — the player is presented with simple controls:
- Two arrows pointing in opposite directions for left and right movement
- Jump arrow
- Shoot button
- Shield button
A question is displayed, and three books come from the right, each one containing an answer, but only one is correct. The player can either shoot at the answer or touch it with the character.

### Obstacles
Obstacles come from above, with a warning sign every time an obstacle spawns. If one hits the player, it will decrease the player's health by 1. Obstacles can also be destroyed by the player shooting at or the shield touching them.

### Difficulties
There are three different difficulties the player can choose, each one affecting the gameplay's pace:
##### Easy
- Slow obstacle spawn rate
- Simplest questions in the game
- Ideal for beginners and elementary school students
##### Medium
- Faster obstacle spawn rate
- Moderately challenging questions
- Good balance for middle school students or anyone who finds Easy too simple
##### Hard
- Highest obstacle frequency, with minimal spawn delay
- Most difficult set of questions
- Designed for players seeking a real challenge, from high school students to competitive adults
##### All players may choose any difficulty they prefer — the goal is to have fun while learning.
